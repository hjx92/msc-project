\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The rail shooter was one of the earliest attempts to bring video
games into the third-dimension - first through the use of pseudo-3D
scaling effects, and later through the use of real-time polygonal graphics.

This project seeks to explore this category of interactive software through a
modern implementation incorportating polygonal rendering for PICO-8 - a
``fantasy console'' which replicates the computational and data constraints of
historical system hardware on which developers typically eschewed polygonal
rendering for simpler 2D effects.

[To be outlined and written after composition of rest of main body]


\section{Background and context}

\subsection{The rail shooter}

\subsubsection*{Historical outline}
Give broad overview of significance of rail shooters in the development of approaches
to 3D game design and chart their development with a focus on:

Early entires in the genre relied primarily on sprite-scaling effects facilitated first by
Sega's Super Scaler arcade board, and later (in more primitve form) by the publisher's
home consoles. \textit{Space Harrier}, which debuted on the Super Scaler board in 1985, demonstrated
the utility of the approach for fast paced action combat games, allowing players to enter a bizarre
fantasy sci-fi world in which an unnamed space man levitates through space and blasts a variety of
enemy craft and alien creatures with a powerful energy gun. Meanwhile \textit{Hang-On} showcased its use
for games in the racing genre, simulating approaching sharp turns and rival motorcyles with an illusion
of 3D depth.

Both of these distinctive Super Scaler game genres - the rail shooter and the pseudo-3D
racer - would see continued development in the years to come with more sophisticated arcade board
technology that allowed developers to depict a greater number of sprites and apply more complex
transformations on them, such as real-time rotation. Of these later entries, \textit{After Burner} is the
most notable of the rail shooters, allowing players to take control of a supersonic fighter jet, while
\textit{Outrun} remains the most iconic of the Super Scaler driving games.

In 1993, Argonaut Software's acclaimed title \textit{Star Fox} for the Super Nintendo Entertainment
System took the genre a step further with the integration of real-time polygonal graphics. Auguemting
the SNES with the Super FX chip - an on-cartridge co-processor for graphics acceleration -
\textit{Star Fox} saw players traverse worlds with polygonal enemies and simple 3D world geometry,
engaging in the genre's staple aim-and-shoot gameplay while also moving through gates.

Sega's 1995 title \textit{Panzer Dragoon}, launched for the Sega Saturn before its international
rollout, brought richer texture-mapped 3D worlds and a celebrated orchestral soundrack by composer
Yoshitaka Azuma, once again showcasing advances in home console technology - in this case, the
shift to less memory constrained disc-based media.

The genre reached its artist apotheosis with \textit{Rez} in 2001 for the Sega Dreamcast.
The game uses wireframe graphics to depict a hacker's infiltration of a computer system, and exploits the
scripted nature of the genre by synchonising gameplay to an intense techno music soundtrack.

The game also made interesting design decisions as a response to the Dreamcast's antiquated
single-analogue input that continue to be felt on modern systems to which the game has been ported and
continues to be popular - most notably to the Xbox 360 as \textit{Rez HD}, and to the PlayStation 4,
PlayStation 5, and Oculus Quest as \textit{Rez Infinite} with new VR modes.

\subsubsection*{Gameplay taxonomy}
% Describe the basic structure of a 3D rail shooter with reference to the above examples,
% outlining their various approaches to core gameplay elements like enemy design, player
% movement, shooting and targetting, significant action set-pieces, and their use of
% fixed perspective or a malleable 3D camera.

Rail shooters have a relatively straightforward gameplay structure, in which players are
automatically carried forward along a fixed path - within which they exercise a fairly
limited range of motion along their relative x-axis and y-axis, and within which they
shoot enemies, and avoid both environmental obstacles and incoming enemy fire. In early instances,
the player moves in a straight line with limited freedom to veer (without gameplay consequence),
while later entries in the genre guided players through more complex spatial compositions incorportating
curves and varied levels of elevation.

Player movement typically doubles up as player aiming too - in early iterations of the genre like
\textit{Space Harrier} and \textit{Star Fox}, movement is tied directly to the player's aim in a
linear fashion, and in later polygonal titles the player directly controls the player's targetting
reticle with player model movement following in an indirect fashion. This differs from modern 3D
game input systems in which player movement and player aiming are controlled independently via dual 
analogue control - this sequence of games were largely developed in tandem with the rise of 3D console
gaming, and largely fell out of fashion before dual analogue input became ubiquitous following the
2000 launch of Sony's PlayStation 2.

% investigate camera controls in PD Orta, PD Remake, and Rez Infinite...

Later games in the cycle did contain rudimentary camera controls, however, with \textit{Panzer Dragoon}
allowing players to rotate the camera in 90 degree chunks using the Sega Saturn's shoulder inputs.
Players were able to see the location of off-camera enemies via a low fidelity radar in the heads up
display, requiring strategic decision making about which of four directions to shoot from.

% Discuss boss set pieces - eg multisprite enemies in Space Harrier, ship in Dragoon, sphere in Rez
\subsubsection*{Genre pitfalls}
Evidence common criticisms of 3D rail shooters as ``glorified technical demos'' with
limited room for gameplay innovation and discuss their waning significance in
commercial game design - with appropriate counter-examples of cult following for
balance.

\subsection{PICO-8}\label{pico}

Brief discussion of decision-making process involved in choosing PICO-8 as tool, with focus on
project scope, interest in technical implementation details, and 3D modelling demands of building
such a game in an off-the-shelf 3D game engine ala Unreal or Unity.
\subsubsection*{Introduction to PICO-8}
% Discuss ethos of PICO-8 as a ``fantasy console'' and outline its technical
% specification - emphasis on compute power, memory limitations, screen resolution,
% player inputs, and token limits - and indicate some of the implications of these
% constraints on project scope.

... PICO-8 preamble ...

The system is built around the following key constraints\cite{white}:

\begin{itemize}
   \item a 128x128 pixel display
   \item a fixed palette of 16 colours
   \item execution of four million virtual instructions per second
   \item a sheet of 128 8x8 sprites
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{PICO-8 as prototyping tool}
Discuss benefits of using PICO-8 as a tool for rapid creation and iteration of
game prototypes, compare and contrast to full 3D engines like Unity, Godot and Unreal,
describe suitability given fixed time constraints of an individual summer
project, and point to games successfully prototyped in PICO-8 (most notably
\textit{Celeste}).

\subsubsection*{Sprite-scaling functionality}
% Discuss PICO-8's given functionality for sprite drawing and scaling and explain how
% these would facilitate development of a low-fidelity game utilising a pseudo-3D
% Super Scaler approach.
One specific advantage of using PICO-8 for this project, in addition to its general
advantages as a prototyping tool, is in-built support not only for drawing sprites
from a sheet but also for dynamically scaling sprites - the core rendering technique
that underlies the early Super Scaler games outlined in the previous section.

In addition to the standard sprite drawing call spr() - which is ideally suited to
typical 2D games in which sprites are drawn at a constant size - PICO-8 also offers
an sspr() function that allows the programmer to dynamically scale and stretch sprites.
This, wrapped in functionality to project points in 3D space to points on a 2D screen,
allows the sort of sprite scaling that can simulate depth in 3D space among
multiple 2D sprite assets.

Where PICO-8 is disadvantaged is in the lack of support for arbitrary rotation of sprites -
a limitation imposed both by PICO-8's effort to emulate 8-bit games systems, which did not yet
have this facility, but also by the coarseness of the platform's pixel grid and the low fidelity
of accompanying sprites which resist easy rotation around small angles.

\subsubsection*{Extensibility of 2D primatives for 3D}
% Discuss \textit{Star Fox} as exemplar polygonal rail shooter built within similar
% constraints and make critical comparison between PICO-8 platform specification and
% the Super Nintendo with on-cartridge Super FX graphics chip.
One ambition of this project, however, is to go a step beyond sprite scaling effects
and also introduce a limited degree of polygonal rendering - following the example of
Argonaut Software's 1993 Super Nintendo title \textit{Star Fox}, which leveraged bespoke
hardware to drive polygon rendering which is beyond PICO-8 only in scale.

% Discuss extensibility of PICO-8's functions for drawing primitives (eg rectfill and line)
% for triangle rasterisation and polygonal rendering.
Since, at root, polygonal rendering only requires the ability to draw triangles onto a
screen, PICO-8 can therefore perform the requisite functions if given primitive shape calls such
as line() and rectfill() are appropriately extended to draw filled shapes between three points.

\subsubsection*{3D experimentation in PICO-8}
Broad overview of existing experimentation with polygonal 3D in PICO-8 with a
focus on \textit{PICO-Fox} as closest analogue. 

Discuss exposed limitations of approach - particularly heavy cost of geometry data
for 3D models, and limitations imposed on design by use of polygonal enemies as
standard (ie minimum size constraint forced by low readability of small 3D models
on a coarse pixel grid).

\subsubsection*{Mitigation strategies for constraints}
Discuss apparent mitigation stategies to work effectively with PICO-8 in light of
the known constraints of the system. Emphasis on:
\begin{itemize}
   \item aggressive use of OOP to eliminate code dupication and preserve token count;
   \item use of standard 30Hz display mode rather than higher-refresh 60Hz mode, to
   trivially double frame budget when drawing and manipulating 3D models;
   \item a blended 2D/3D approach that reserves polygonal rendering for the player
   sprite and for boss encounters, and allows the flexibility and low cost of
   sprite-based gameplay throughout the rest of the core gameplay loop;
   \item possible growth into a ``multicart'' game, in violation of a basic intended
   constraint of the system, as a last resort to deal with token limits.
\end{itemize}

% OOP

One of the most pressing constraints when developing for PICO-8 is the per-cart token
limit, which constrains the amount of code the can define your game. It is therefore
imperitive to practice good discipline in coding, avoiding code duplication and making use
of well structured object-oriented software architecture. PICO-8 carts are written in the
Lua scripting language, which is not traditionally object-oriented but which does have the
facilities to allow a form of prototype-based object orientation using metatables.
% use quotes from the Lua book 

% frame target ?? to keep or to cull...

Another obvious mitigation is to use the console's default 30Hz refresh mode rather than
the optional 60Hz mode. While faster refresh creates a more fluid and responsive game,
it trivially halves your frame budget.

% blended approach

While the project aims to incorporate polygonal rendering, one important mitigation against
PICO-8's constraints is to not dogmatically adopt a purely polygonal approach and instead
opt for a blended approach that uses both polygonal and sprite-based rendering in a
blended way, allowing for more action on screen while allowing perspective-correct 3D models
in situations where they benefit the game.

% multi cart

One further possible mitigation involves eschewing one of the system's constraints entirely.
PICO-8 does allow carts to load and run other carts, allowing developers to sidestep token
limits and build out multi-cart games, in which sections of the game are broken out into
separate discrete carts - perhaps sharing some assets and functionality - and then chained
together using load and run calls.

This approach will be discussed in more detail in Section \ref{multicart}, since it was an
approach ultimately taken in the final stretch of the project.


\section{Implementation I: Prototyping}

\subsection{Paper prototyping, software prototyping, and 3D rendering test}
The prototyping phase of the project began with three pieces of work along two tracks: firstly,
a paper prototype concretising the core gameplay loop, in which the player moves forward through
space and encounters enemies, and a software implementation of that paper prototype in PICO-8; and
secondly, initial technical work confirming the potential of PICO-8 for polygonal rendering and
allowing me to start getting to grips with the basic ideas behind real-time rendering in general.

\subsubsection*{Basic player actions using primatives}

\label{fig:gameprototype}
\end{figure}

Referring back to the gameplay taxonomy conducted in the background section, explain
how the most significant user actions were distilled down to fit a six-input
gamepad. Showcase how this was modelled using a flat paper prototype and outline
how this was translated into a software prototype using primitive shapes to model
the player and randomly spawned enemies, with movement and interactions being
directly translated into screen-space.

Highlight issues already identified at this early stage of prototyping - such as
player model blocking, the relationship between the player reticle and the destination
of projectiles in hypothecated 3D space, the need for limitations on enemy
target locking, and the need for game objects to have a meaningful existence in 3D
space.

\subsubsection*{Simple 3D renderer with model scaling and rotations}

% Describe the contruction of a simple 3D renderer to prove suitability of PICO-8 for
% the proposed project. Expose and discuss my implementation of triangle rasterisation
% in PICO-8 and briefly explain the benefits of decomposing 3D shapes into triangles
% rather than quads. Discuss related issues in polygonal rendering such as triangle
% sorting and backface culling.

While working on the initial software prototype outlined above, a second course of work
was followed to confirm the capacity of PICO-8 to render polygonal models and to begin
building the required functionality over and above PICO-8's primitive drawing functions.

Firstly, a simple algorithm was implemented to draw a filled triangle between three points
in screen space, using line-by-line rect() calls to draw lines between appropriate points on the
sides of the triangle. The rectangular draw function rect() is used
rather than the more intuitive line() function, because PICO-8's implementation of line drawing
includes additional overhead to calculate best fitting lines between diagonal points, even when
drawing lines between two points that share a position on one axis.

Triangles are used as the building block for polygonal rendering because three points, which define
a plane in 3D space, guarantee stable flat surfaces - whereas quad rendering can produce surfaces
between points that are under-described, with a fourth point sitting on a different plane to the
other three and creating ambiguities in the relation of points across a surface. It should be
noted, however, that nothing forces us to use triangles - and indeed the Sega Saturn did render
polygonal graphics using texture mapped quads.

% triangle algorithm

The coordinate points of the triangle are first sorted by their \textit{y}-axis position. The
per-line step required to draw the long side is then calculated by dividing the \textit{x}-axis
distance between the highest and lowest point by their distance in \textit{y}.

The two shorter sides are then calculated by performing the same operation between the highest
and middle points, and again between the middle point and the lowest point. Appropriate logic is
included to handle edge cases too - for example, where two or three points share a position in
\textit{y}.

% point projection

Once triangle drawing functionality was built, functionality to translate 3D coordinates onto
screen space was required. This was done through the use of point projection calculations which
will be discussed in more detail in Section \ref{conversion},
where its broader application to the game software itself will be covered.

% description of 3D models

3D models are described by giving the position of their vertices in 3D model space - that is,
with the object centred around origin (0, 0, 0) so that it can easily be scaled and rotated
before being translated into a more specific world space location. The vertices are then connected
in data defining the triangles they form in the model, with points listed in clockwise order from
the outside to establish their orientation and enable techniques like backface culling.

% discuss scaling and rotation functions

% discuss triangle sorting and backface culling

% PERHAPS include code for triangle drawing and polygonal rendering... hmm... 

% Showcase the results of the ``sanity test'', in which multiple
% cubes are drawn to the screen progressively in order to understand the relative
% computational cost of tracking and drawing 3D geometry in PICO-8 and the feasibility
% of real-time polygonal rendering given system constraints and my existing quality
% of implementation.

Once the core rendering functionality had been built for a single cube, the functionality
was subjected to a simple ``sanity test'' to establish confidence that the performance
cost of polygonal rendering in PICO-8 was not too heavy to preclude its use in the
game.

Using common model space data, nine cubes were defined in our PICO-8 cart with simple inputs
to cycle through the numbers being rendered at any one time. Figure \ref{fig:3dprototype}
outlines the results of the testing with backface culling enabled.

% redo these tests - test with and without backface culling and also test a control where
% cubes do not exist unless they are drawn...

\subsection{3D conversion of software prototype}\label{conversion}

While the initial software prototype served a useful purpose in creating familiarity
with the basic mechanics and feel of the game, and sparking early thinking about some of the
significant design decisions that needed to be made, its origins in a flat paper prototype
also led to key technical implimentation issues being elided - namely the accurate handling
of depth and perspective necessary to properly deliver on the initial idea of the project.

As such, the initial software prototype was built on in the next phase of development and refactored
so that objects carried proper three-dimensional positions in world space, and were drawn in a
properly scaled and perspective correct way instead of having movement in depth faked through
arbitrary re-scaling in screen space. Likewise, collision handling was re-written to accurately detect
intersections of bounding volumes in three-dimensional space, instead of being handled through
screen space intersection in a 2D plane.

\subsubsection*{Perspective-correct 3D projection and scaling}
% Discuss the application of 3D point projection to the corners of 2D sprite objects
% to achieve perspective correct drawing and scaling of 2D elements using PICO-8's sspr
% function. Highlight use of small camera movements (spatial displacement in x and y)
% aligned to player sprite movement to heighten illusion of depth along the z-axis.
One of the key changes introduced in this 3D software prototype was the creation of accurate
depth among enemy units, created by correctly projecting sprite objects onto the screen using
newly introduced \textit{z}-coordinate values.

In order to accurately project a point from 3D space onto a screen, we must hypothecate a viewport in 3D space
and a camera position, and then exploit the law of similar triangles to identify the point in space at
which the the line between the point and our camera - which will be positioned at at the origin of the
coordinate system, (0, 0, 0), for simplicity - intersects with our viewport.

   \caption{side orthographic view of a point projection on the \textit{y}-axis, adapted from figure 9-2 of Gambetta
   \cite[p. 106]{gambetta}}
   \label{fig:triangles}
\end{figure}

This operation must be performed along both the \textit{x} and \textit{y} axes, and figure \ref{fig:triangles}
illustrates how the law of similar triangles can be used to determine viewport projection of point \textit{P}
in the \textit{y}-axis as an example. \cite[p. 106]{gambetta}

Because triangles OBP and OAP' are similar triangles - that is, they are right angled triangles that have the same
internal angles - we can leverage the fact that, as similar triangles, the ratio of their equivalent sides is the same.

Therefore we can say that the ratio of lengths OA and AP' is the same as the ratio of lengths OB and BP. If we know
the coordinate position of point P, we know that OB is its position in \textit{z} and BP is its position in \textit{y}.
We also know that length OA is simply the distance between the camera and the viewport - a distance which we know because
we have hypothecated these objects in 3D space ourselves. As a consequence, the length of the line AP' is:

\begin{equation}
   |AP'| = \frac{|BP| * |OA|} {|OB|}
\end{equation}

or, the \textit{y} coordinate of the point, projected onto the viewport V, is:

\begin{equation}
   V_y = \frac{P_y * V_z} {P_z}
\end{equation}

Once this calculation is made, we simply need to translate the figures for our actual screen or canvas, which uses different
measures from our in-scene viewport, and this is achieved by multiplying the calculated coordinate by the width or height of
our canvas in pixels (128 in both axes in PICO-8), and dividing this by the in-scene width or height of our viewport.

In figure \ref{fig:equationsproject} we see how this calculation can be simplified by hypothecating a 1 by 1 in-scene viewport and
a viewport distance of 1 in \textit{z} - since any number divided or multiplied by 1 remains unchanged, we can simply eliminate
arbitrary multiplications and divisions from our computation and scale our scenes for this set-up. The downside of this approach,
however, is that it does lock us into a particular field of view.

Finally, the position value must be adjusted to account for the fact that the centre of our in-scene viewport looks directly
along the \textit{z}-axis along \textit{x}, \textit{y} coordinates of (0, 0), whereas (0, 0) on our canvas exists
in the top left corner of the screen rather than the centre, and the positive direction of \textit{y} is therefore
inverted on our screen too.

This entire operation is implemented in the code highlighted in figure \ref{fig:codeproject} using a single short function
that takes a three-component vector - representing the \textit{x}, \textit{y}, and \textit{z} coordinates of a
vertex in space - and projects them onto a viewport of width and height 1, centred around (0, 0) and located
one unit along the \textit{z}-axis. This returns two values, for screen projection in \textit{x} and \textit{y}.

This function is called twice for each sprite drawn, finding the position of the top-left and bottom-right
corners of its face - derived from an object's position, its width, and its height - and then drawing the
sprite using PICO-8's in-built scaled sprite function sspr(), discussed in Section 2.2.

Figure \ref{fig:projection} illustrates how this process renders scenes using perspective projection.
While it highlights the use of this function to project the extreme corners of 2D sprites onto a screen,
the same method is also used by the program to project the three vertices of triangles onto screen space
too - allowing the rendering of polygonal shapes such as the player ship and the icosahedral boss enemy shell,
or the polygonal cubes discussed in the previous section. Discussion of \textit{z}-sorting to ensure proper
ordering as well as proper scaling of objects will be picked up in Section 4.3.

end
   \end{lstlisting}
   \caption{vertex projection function}
   \label{fig:codeproject}
\end{figure}

Note: in the implementation highlighted in figure \ref{fig:codeproject} from the software prototype, displacements
in the \textit{x} and \textit{y} axes were added to represent relative motion of the camera - although this
effect was later removed from the final version of the game, since it tended to make the gameplay harder to reason

\subsubsection*{Real-time 3D collisions}

% Discuss implementation of cuboid bounding volumes to test for collisions, using
% height, width, and depth data paired if three-dimensional positions to check for
% intersection of volumes. Discuss the need for axis-alignment to significantly
% simplify calculations, and the design implications of this with regard to rotational
% symmetry of objects depicted (ie disc-shaped saucers, and spherical projectiles)

Having translated the game into 3D world space for the purposes of perspective-correct rendering, adjusting
the game's collision system was the next logical step.

In the initial software prototype, without \textit{z} values to work with, single pixel projectiles were simply
fired across the screen in a 2D plane with simple checks to see if they had entered the player (represented in
the initial prototype as a hollow rectangle) or enemies (represented as solid circles). This became untenable
as a solution, given that it jarred with perspective-correct rendering of enemy units, and the prototype was
updated to test for collisions using cuboid bounding volumes.

Cuboid bounding volumes can have two principal uses in a collision detection system. In complex simulations,
checks for intersection between cuboid volumes can be used as a pruning mechanism - an initial approximation
to either disconfirm that intersection has occurred, or else call for a more complex test of the actual
geometry being bounded. In more simple systems, such as the low-fidelity game being built in this project,
cuboid volumes can be used effectively to test for collisions in general.\cite[p. 75]{ericson}

Two of the most desirable characteristics of bounding volumes are tightness of fit with underlying geometry,
and ease of rotation and transformation.\cite[p. 76]{ericson} As such, an early design decision was made to
populate the game with objects that are exactly (or close to exactly) rotationally symmetrical.

Therefore projectiles are depicted as spheres, rather than taking on a tapered bullet-shaped appearance. The main
enemy units are depicted as round flying saucers. Both objects can be represented in collision space in
axis-aligned cuboid bounding volumes that do not need to rotate at all to reflect any putative rotation of
the object in space, significantly simplifying intersection calculations.

Although these bounding volumes are not perfect matches for the objects being represented, they are sufficiently
tightly bound to simulate a plausible system of collisions - to quote Christer Ericson, veteran programmer of Sony
Santa Monica and NeverSoft, ``in games, collision detection and response can effectively be governed by `if it looks
right, it is right.' Other applications have stricter accuracy requirements.''\cite[p. 12]{ericson}

\end{figure}

Since the game records the position of game objects through a single three-coordinate vector at the object's
centre, axis-aligned bounding volumes use a centre-radius representation\cite[p. 78]{ericson}, as seen in
figure \ref{fig:colfig1}, in which the bounds of the volume are defined by positional data and values for the
object's height, width, and depth - of which height and width are already used for rendering.

Collisions between objects of this representation are then calculated using a simple series of checks comparing
the absolute distance between the objects on each axis by the difference of their radius along that axis as
depicted in figure \ref{fig:colfig2} - here derived as the sum of their relevant extensions divded by two as
outlined in figure \ref{fig:colequation} and implemented in code in figure \ref{fig:codecollide}.

   $e_1$ and $e_2$ are corresponding values representing the object's extension along that axis

end
   \end{lstlisting}
   \caption{a boolean check for collision between two axis-aligned bounding volumes}
   \label{fig:codecollide}
\end{figure}

Several known optimisations have been eschewed in this implementation due to token limits in PICO-8
imposing a cost to additional code overhead, in addition to the fact that collision-related performance
bottlenecks have not been encountered - in no small part due to the design decisions mentioned above.
Therefore, spatial partioning for example has not been implemented. But a more bespoke form of divide-and-conquer
strategy has been implemented to reduce the number of pairwise collision checks, and avoid the quadratic
time complexity of naively testing all combinations, by only checking for collisions between specific
classes of object and rendering other collisions irrelevant to the game.

For example, the player can collide with enemy projectiles and drone enemies, but no check is performed
for collisions with saucer enemies since their behaviour is such that they never share a horizontal
plane with the player. Likewise, saucer enemies do not check for collisions with other saucers - they are 
assumed not to collide, and when collisions do happen in the gameworld the graphical low-fidelity of the
game allows their intersection to be interpreted perceptually as close-by rather than intersecting motion -
and, as such, any such intersection has no consequence that needs to be resolved.

\subsubsection*{Graphical effects with 2D sprites and particles}

As indicated in the prior section, techniques to simplify the process of 3D collision detection naturally
suggested particular decisions for the graphical design of the game - namely a bias towards using rotationally
symmetrical objects that can be bound to axis-aligned cuboid bounding volumes without concern about object
rotation in world space.

As such, representations of enemy units as primitive circles were replaced with a simple sprite representing
a flying saucer as seen in Figure \ref{fig:saucer} - an easily identifiable object, consistent with a science-fiction theme, that contains the
rough rotational symmetry required by the simplified collision system.

Destruction effects were also added to the game, composed of two components - an animated explosion, which
served as the background to the effect, and a foreground system of particles in randomly assigned colours
drawn from the sprite of the destroyed object.

Explosions - represented like other projected objects through a 3D position vector and radius information -
are animated using progressive radius expansion at a semi-random rate assigned on object initialisation.
Further animation within the sprite was achieved inexpensively by leveraging the xflip and yflip parameters
of PICO-8's sspr() function, which allows sprites to be flipped independently in either, neither, or both of the
\textit{x} and \textit{y} axes. By adding a simple timer to the objects, we are able to create the illusion of
organic motion within the explosion sprite by arbitrary flipping over time - exploiting intentional asymmetries
in the sprite's pixel grid as seen in Figure \ref{fig:explosion_sprite}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{subfigure}{.45\textwidth}

\end{subfigure}\hfill
\caption{sprite designs}
\label{fig:sprites}
\end{figure}

Particles, likewise, are spawned on the destruction of an enemy in semi-random numbers and assigned semi-random
values to make the effect feel unscripted and organic. Particles are assigned colour values corresponding to
values found in the original enemy sprite, creating an illusion of debris, and then assigned random directions
and speed factors that execute over a given number of subsequent frames against the backdrop of a randomly
expanding and flipping explosion animation.

% Describe the implementation of 2D sprites to replace primitive shapes used in earlier
% iterations of the prototype. Discuss the design considerations that led to the
% adoption of easily identifiable flying saucer and drone designs. Discuss simple
% graphical effects used to eg light up flying saucer lights, or spin rotors of
% enemy drones. Explain implementation of enemy destruction effects - namely the
% implementation of a simple particle system over the bed of an explosion animation
% efficiently faked by a combination of progressive scaling and random flipping of a
% non-symmetrical sprite.

\section{Implementation II: Full implementation}

Following extensive prototyping and the development of a functional software version that
implemented the core intended gameplay loop and incorporated both perspective-correct sprite projection,
polygonal rendering, and real-time collision detection in 3D space, it was time to start work on
the final implementation - starting with a properly designed software architecture and object
hierarchy that built on the lessons of early prototyping and properly ordered the software in
a rational, DRY, and polymorphic way.

In addition to a significant ground-up reworking of the second software prototype, development
also began on the end-game boss - featuring a more interactive polygonal element - and associated
problems with 3D geometry. This phase of the project also, ultimately, saw the project shift toward
a multicart design following a late encounter with PICO-8 token limits.

\subsection{Settled software architecture and object hierarchy}
Discuss the software architecture and walk through the significant parts of the
class diagram that was drafted at the end of software prototyping. Explain how the
design was informed by prototyping and broader game systems architecture reading.
Describe how game flow is controlled within the architecture. Descibe how game object
subclassing of sprite objects and polygonal objects facilitates the blended
2D/3D rendering approach outlined earlier in a polymorphic way. 

\subsection{Transition to multi-cart design}\label{multicart}
Discuss late impact of token limit. Discuss decision to eschew imposed limitation of
PICO-8 and convert game to a multi-cart project. Discuss benefits of approach, including
introduction of straightforward game start/game over/restart logic based on storage of
pertinent persistent data and use of cart reloading. 

\subsection{The core game loop}
Describe the core gameplay loop and give a comprehensive tour of the update and draw
functions in main.lua that execute it, explaining the rationale for event and draw
sequencing. Discuss the z-sort implementation in draw, comparing to alternative sorting
algortithms, and describe how polymorphic class design enables heterogeneous elements
to be drawn together in the correct depth ordering.

\subsubsection*{The update loop}
Discuss gameworld object.

Outline update process of gameworld: character health check and possible exit to Game Over screen,
management of particular gameplay wave including generation of a new wave if necessary, followed by
an update of the existing or new wave, player update including inputs, followed finally by management
of game scenery, bullets, and various pick-up items.

Discuss the use of multicarting to control game menus, reset game state, and transition to boss mode
if the given wave target is reached.

Discuss the operations involved in the wave class - including selection of wave type, and how various
types of wave operate at initialisation and over the first 300 ticks of gameplay to generate enemies
with bespoke synchronised movement patterns.

Discuss the update operations of individual enemies including bullet collision checks, movement, and
timed firing. Discuss consequence of bullet collision, and creation of explosion objects - referring back
to prior section outlining the implementation of the explosion animation and particle effect. Discuss
the decision to use sequential rather than simultaneous movement, its drawbacks, and its suitability for
a video game system.\cite[p. 16]{ericson}

Discuss player input scheme with particular reference to lock-on system.

Discuss scenery, bullet, and pick-up management. Justify timing of bullet update and outline alternative
approaches \cite{nystrom}.
\subsubsection*{The draw loop}
Discuss the initial drawing of a flat surface using rectfill() and its population by scrolling scenery.
Discuss the design decisions behind the use of trees, rocks, and clouds and their ability to be easily
rotated without jarring consequence. Discuss positioning of scenery outside the effective range of
play, and why this makes it appropriate to draw static scenery first.

Discuss the use of the z-sort algorithm to correctly order sprites and polygonal objects
for correct ordering by depth. 

Refer to earlier 3D projection discussion and discuss how this is used as the foundation for
spriteobject level draw calls that use object-level sprite-sheet data.

Discuss the use of pal() calls to simulate lights and rotary blades in the saucer and drone
enemies.

Discuss the use of backface culling for the player ship and the decision to draw backfaces
within the boss, allowing for the use of a hollow ``shell'' shape to enhance gameplay.

Discuss the use of recoloured sprites and semi-random sprite flipping to draw player thrusters
with a dynamic quality.

Discuss the in-game HUD. Trace its development from the initial software prototype, its brief
abandonment, and its reintroduction following user testing feedback about the failure of players
to engage with more traditional HUD elements on the borders of the display.

\subsection{Boss mode}

\end{figure}

Discuss thinking behind 3D boss design - with emphasis on opportunity to explore additional way to
navigate 3D space with similar constraints to rail shooter genre. Compare to boss set-pieces in
\textit{Panzer Dragoon} and \textit{Rez}.

\subsubsection*{Camera rotations in 3D space}

% Discuss the implementation of camera rotations around a point in 3D space for the
% creation of a ``boss mode'' which involves strafing around a polygonal enemy. 

In order to execute on this concept, a new camera mode had to be built for the game.
Whereas the general course of play sees the camera in a fixed position at origin, looking
along the \textit{z}-axis while enemies and geometry scroll towards it and the player
model moves in a fixed two-dimensional plane parallel to the viewport, a boss setpiece in
which the player ship strafes around a polygonal enemy required the camera to sweep in a 
circle around the boss.

Camera transformations, in this implementation, work on the principle that real camera
transformations and the application of contrary transformations on scenery objects
produce like results. As such, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:rotation}, camera transformations
in this mode are accomplished by transforming world scenery to simulate the movement of the camera.

In this example, to rotate objects in a scene around an arbitrary point, the objects are
translated by the inverse of the position vector of the point of rotation, rotated around
origin, and translated by by the positive position vector of the initial point.

As implemented in the game, this means that objects in the game world are rotated around
the position of the boss - at coordinates (0, 0, 5) - in the opposite direction to the
putitive movement of the camera as generated by player input, in order to generate the
phenomeon of a camera sweeping through space.

% Highlight the implications of this change on the position and orientation of the player model,
% which can no longer exist naively in a 2D plane facing along the z-axis but which
% must now be able to exist in a rotational relationship to a focal point in the map,
% shared with the camera.

This change also forced reconsideration of how the position of the player is defined
in the game world, and associated issues such as direction of fire. Whereas the position
of the player ship had previously been defined as a point in 3D space confined to a 2D
plane parallel to the camera viewport, free-firing projectiles directly down the \textit{z}-axis,
strafing motion around a stationary boss setpiece required the position of the ship to instead
be defined by an angle around a unit circle.

Two alternative approaches to free-firing under this new approach were considered. Firstly,
the technically correct approach, would see the ship firing directly forward as it faced - with
the unfortunate implication that all shots would ultimately travel through the centre of
rotation, and thus cause undue constraint on player action. The alternative, which was adopted,
saw the ship maintain its freedom to fire from arbitrary points on a 2D plane by directing
bullets down the direction faced by the camera rather than the player ship - a trade-off
that favoured game feel over accurate simulation.

% Discuss the relationship between in-frame player movement,
% the implied field of view of a 1x1 canvas at single unit distance from pinhole, and
% camera rotation around a point. Discuss the per-object rotations required to execute
% such camera movements, density of spawned scenery, and concerns around computational
% load.

\subsubsection*{Ray-triangle collision with the Möller–Trumbore algorithm}
Discuss the need for more complex ray-triangle intersection computations to effectively
test for collisions around the boss enemy, since the intended design requires per-face
collision detection on a regular icosahedron whose faces cannot be satisfactorily
split into non-overlapping cuboid bounding volumes that adequately approximate
collisions.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Think-aloud testing feedback}
Discuss feedback gathered by think-aloud testing sessions, and highlight adaptations
to the software intended to answer constructive criticisms. Possible subjects of
discussion:
\begin{itemize}
   \item implementation of on-player HUD to answer lack of player attention on vital
   gameplay statistics, ie remaining life and state of lock-on targetting;
   \item redesign of pick-up sprites to better differentiate power-ups from
   damage-inducing projectiles;
   \item introduction of narrative splash screen to justify on-screen action, which
   was seen as random and unexplained.
\end{itemize}
Also discuss positive feedback gathered during sessions, such as satisfaction
with the game controls, hit detection, and overall aesthetic of the game, and comfort
with depth perception despite the low-resolution pixel grid.
\subsection{Formal NASA-TLX testing}
I also subjected my programme to one round of quantitative testing to investigate the
relative contributions of enemy speed and enemy fire rate to overall difficulty - as
measured by task load.

This was done through the use of the widely used and validated NASA-TLX survey on which...

TO DO: GENERAL EXPLANATION OF NASA-TLX

Participants were asked to play three builds of the game - a control build, in which enemy
ships behaved in a ``normal'' way, a rapid fire build in which enemy ships move at a standard
speed but fire more quickly, and a rapid movement build in which the rate of fire is the same
as in the control but the ships move faster.

\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Pitfalls of paper prototyping for 3D projects}
Discuss issues raised by developing initial software prototype from a paper prototype
- with emphasis on inate tendancy of paper prototyping to flatten images to a surface,
mask issues relating to depth-in-space, and discourage serious thinking about the
relationship between world-space and screen-space in projects like this.
\subsection{Artificial limits imposed by featly to platform ethos}
Discuss late move to multicart approach and the creative envelope it opened - too late
in the project. Discuss attempts to remain within arbitrary token limit for much of the
project and speculate about additional game modes that could have been introduced hardware
a multicart approach been taken sooner (including both alternative boss designs, more
data-intensive 3D ideas, and variations on the core gameplay loop)
\subsection{Unavoidable limitations imposed by PICO-8}
Discuss issues caused by coarseness of PICO-8 pixel grid and difficulties caused by
limited fixed colour palette of PICO-8, and its impact on effective shading of polygonal
models. Discuss use of music and sound in \textit{Rez} and limitations imposed by PICO-8's
low-fi sound system - with equal recognition of creative limitations of developer.

\subsubsection*{Sideways chase}
Discuss possibility of side-on scrolling action as seen in \textit{Panzer Dragoon} and \textit{Rez}.
Discuss feasibility of implementation given multi-cart approach and existence of functionality to
rotate camera around an arbitrary point.

IF TIME: BUILD RUDIMENTARY PROTOTYPE

\subsubsection*{Shmup mode}
Brief explanation of shmups. Discuss affinity between rail shooters and shmups. Describe rail section
of \textit{Split Fiction} and seamless transition between game modes. Discuss feasibility given
existing codebase.

\subsection{Change of technology}

As outlined in Section \ref{pico}, PICO-8 is an excellent prototyping tool. But it is inherently
limited, and one obvious course of future work would be to translate the game to more robust technology
and explore the creative possibilities unlocked by a less constrained development environment - most
notabily in graphical effects and in sound synchronisation.

\subsubsection*{Fully-featured game engine: Unreal, Unity, Godot}
Briefly outline various off-the-shelf 3D game engines. Discuss the pros and cons with working with
established technology including robust systems for handling 3D rendering and camera activity. Discuss
drawbacks of the technology. 

\subsubsection*{Minimal game development library: raylib}
Discuss possible alternative benefits of developing using a minimal library like raylib,
which offers similarly freeform low-overhead development to PICO-8 without extraneous
constraints. Note flexibility of the library and ability to use bindings in a range of
languages rather than just Lua or the specified scripting languages imposed by fully-featured
off-the-shelf game engines.
