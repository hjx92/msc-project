wc 23/06
- ideation and implementation of primative enemy movement patterns
- - "sweep" pattern
- - "spread" pattern
- - "circle" pattern
- altered player_ship thruster implementation
- start of UML class diagram

wc 16/06
- Game architecture research (Robert Nystrom, Jason Gregory)
- 3D modelling within game prototype
- naive score tracking and health regeneration system
- additional sound and sprite design (health regen, player cockpit)
- animated enemy explosion and thrusters
- experimented with lock-on limitations (maximum enemy distance from screen, limit of three locks at once, cooldown)
- addition of lock-on related HUD elements

wc 09/06
- rolling static scenery (clouds, forest)
- sprite design and implementation (enemies, static scenery, 2D player sprite)
- initial particle effects
- initial sound design and implementation for key interactions (enemy/player firing, enemy destruction)

wc 02/06
- Project proposal drafting
- start of translation of 2D prototype to 3D prototype (moving enemy objects into 3D world space and projecting to screen)
- 3D prototype sanity checking (9 cubes in different world space - measuring CPU utilisation)

wc 26/05
- 3D graphics programming research (Computer Graphics from Scratch)
- 3D prototyping (single cube)
- modest elaboration of 2D game prototype
- - enemy lock-on system

wc 19/05
- Initial naive 2D prototype
- - scrolling floor (faked using naive guesswork)
- - enemies drawn as primatives (filled circles), with z-axis movement faked by simple scaling
- - player drawn as hollow rectangle, tied to cross-reticle
