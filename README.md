Welcome to the repo for my MSc individual summer project - a 3D rail shooter for the PICO-8 fantasy console.

The game can be played at https://hjx92.github.io/msc-project/

If played on a gamepad, as intended, player inputs typically map in an intuitive fashion - the four D-pad inputs
will correspond to the D-pad of the gamepad, the two face buttons will map to the two primary face buttons of
the gamepad, and the start button will correspond to the start button of the gamepad.

If played on a keyboard, the arrow keys will correspond to the D-pad, the Z and X keys will correspond to
PICO-8's face buttons, and the Enter key will correspond to Start.
